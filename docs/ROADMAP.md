# Roadmap — Competition Management System

## Vision

A multi-tenant SaaS platform where organizations run hackathon-style competitions. Participants register, submit work, judges score against rubrics, and leaderboards update automatically.

Designed as a portfolio project demonstrating real-world Laravel engineering — not just CRUD.

## Domain

- **Type:** Hackathon / event-style competitions
- **Tenancy:** Multi-tenant SaaS (row-level, shared database)
- **Actors:** Platform Super Admin, Organizer, Committee, Judge, Participant, Coach

> Detailed requirements live in [PRD.md](PRD.md). Architectural decisions are logged in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

## Sprint 0 — Project Foundation ✅

**Goal:** Establish a strong, maintainable project foundation.

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| Laravel 12 + Vue starter kit installed | ✅ |
| MySQL + Redis configured | ✅ |
| Authentication (login, register, profile) | ✅ |
| Docker prepared (deployment only) | ✅ |
| Folder structure designed | ✅ |
| Coding standards documented | ✅ |
| Development environment documented | ✅ |

---

## Sprint 1 — Identity & Multi-Tenancy ✅

**Goal:** Organizations exist in isolation. Users belong to one org. Roles determine capabilities.

**Delivered:**

- [x] `Organization` model and migration (name, slug, soft deletes)
- [x] `organization_id`, `role`, `avatar_path`, `deactivated_at`, soft deletes on `users`
- [x] Per-organization email uniqueness (`unique(organization_id, email)`)
- [x] `UserRole` PHP enum (super-admin, organizer, committee, judge, participant, coach)
- [x] Self-service registration → creates organization + first organizer
- [x] Workspace-slug-scoped login; super admin via `platform` slug
- [x] `EnsureUserIsActive` (`active`) and `EnsureOrganizer` (`organizer`) middleware
- [x] `UserPolicy` — view/create/update/delete/deactivate/reactivate/restore
- [x] User CRUD (backend services + controller + Inertia pages)
- [x] Deactivate / reactivate / soft delete
- [x] Profile update + avatar upload + password update
- [x] Super admin seeder
- [x] Feature + unit test coverage (70 tests passing)

**Decisions made** (see [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)):

- Super admin uses a nullable `organization_id` (no separate guard).
- Self-serve org signup enabled now (invite flow deferred).
- No `spatie/laravel-permission` yet — a PHP enum is sufficient.

## Sprint 2 — Competition & Category Management ✅

**Goal:** Organizers create and manage competitions with multiple categories (tracks).

**Domain research:** ✅ Complete — see [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) ADR-0011–0016.  
**Design doc:** ✅ [COMPETITION_DESIGN.md](COMPETITION_DESIGN.md)

### Features

- [x] `Competition` + `CompetitionCategory` models and migrations
- [x] `CompetitionStatus` + `CategoryStatus` enums
- [x] `OrganizationScope` on `Competition`
- [x] Auto-create default "General" category on competition create
- [x] Inherit-with-override config on categories
- [x] Category CRUD (nested under competition)
- [x] Competition CRUD + listing page (organizer view)
- [x] Public competition page
- [x] `CompetitionPolicy` + `CompetitionCategoryPolicy`
- [x] `CompetitionPublished` event
- [x] Feature tests (149 tests passing)

*When each item ships, this checklist and [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md) are updated.*
